      Exploring the Board

     When you log in to
     <span style="color: #29abe2">
      Join
     </span>
     ,
              you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
              and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
              feedback” and "Done".

     , you can add contacts
              to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
              click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
              added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
              with the tasks on the board.

     <h3>
      Adding Cards
     </h3>
     Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
              etc.

     <h3>
      Moving Cards
     </h3>
     As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
              on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
              another.

     <h3>
      Deleting Cards
     </h3>
     Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
              the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
              action is irreversible. Remember that using

     effectively requires
              consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
              reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions
